## 🔍 What is LoopMax

**LoopMax Embedded OS** is a modular framework for embedded systems designed
to provide a **shared core**, independent from hardware and framework,
on top of which complete devices can be built using
**dynamically loaded application modules**.

LoopMax includes a **Web-Based Operating System** and all essential system services,
allowing developers to focus only on application logic.

---

## 🚀 Why LoopMax

Because enough with:

- scattered projects
- duplicated base code
- reinvented web interfaces
- repeated system services on every device

With LoopMax:

- you develop **only your module**
- the **core** is already available
- the **Web OS** is integrated
- the infrastructure is shared
- the device is immediately operational

👉 One system  
👉 One core  
👉 Infinite devices

## 🧩 Architecture (overview)

LoopMax is structured in multiple layers:

- **LoopMax Core**
  - Web-Based OS
  - System services
  - Module management
- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**
  - Multi-framework support (Arduino / ESP-IDF)
  - Multi-board support
- **Application Modules**
  - Weather
  - Sensors
  - Motors
  - Automations
  - Extensible over time

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

LoopMax was created to eliminate embedded project fragmentation
and maximize code reuse.

Every new feature is a **module**,
not a new project from scratch.
